Okay, how do I say this? (fack, fack, fack)
Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, welp (fack, fack)

Yeah, I'm a fucking kamikaze crashing into everything
You beat me Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been going for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome
Stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I T-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned on rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I wasn't
Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by
Dre's Frankenstein, energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, buy some rope on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryna stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, is me rear ending Terreri Bear
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair with [?] beware
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serially killing every therapist, is it-

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feeling something evil is lurking
I'm no conspiracy theorist but something here is afoot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurement stick (what)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been going for your jugular like Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait till I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot
