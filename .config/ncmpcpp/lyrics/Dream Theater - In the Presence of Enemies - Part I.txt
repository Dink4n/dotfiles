I. Prelude
(Instrumental)

II. Resurrection
I saw a white light shining there before me
And walking to it, I waited for the end
A final vision promising salvation
A resurrection for a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God?
And the symbol of your faith

I can free you from this hell and misery
You should never be ashamed, my son
I can give you power beyond anything
Trust me, you will be the chosen one

I was forgotten, a body scorned and broken
My soul rejected, tainted by his blood
Beyond redemption, a sinner not worth saving
Forever taken from the one I loved

Do I still wait for my God?
And the symbol of my faith

I can lead you down the path and back to life
All I ask is that you worship me
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself
Give you life for all eternity

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling
On this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious blade
One man rises up
Standing in their way

Redemption
Redemption for humanity
